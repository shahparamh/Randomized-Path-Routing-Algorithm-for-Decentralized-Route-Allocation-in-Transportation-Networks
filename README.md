# ðŸš¦ Randomized Route Optimization in Decentralized Traffic Networks

This project explores a **probabilistic routing framework** aimed at minimizing average travel time and alleviating congestion in decentralized traffic networks. It was developed as part of **CSE400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing** under the guidance of **Prof. Dhaval Patel**, Ahmedabad University.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

We implement a **Randomized A\*** algorithm that introduces controlled randomness in path selection using a **Boltzmann probability distribution**. The cost function blends actual travel costs with heuristic estimates (Euclidean, Manhattan, Diagonal), promoting exploration of alternative routes.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- **Probabilistic Path Selection**  
  A Boltzmann-like Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used to assign probabilities to paths:

  ![PMF Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{120}P(P_i)=\frac{e^{-\beta%20f(P_i)}}{\sum_j%20e^{-\beta%20f(P_j)}})

  Where:
  - f(P_i) is the cost of path P_i
  - Î² controls randomness Î² = more exploration

- **Heuristics Used**
  - Euclidean Distance  
  - Manhattan Distance  
  - Diagonal Distance  

- **Algorithms Implemented**
  - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (Baseline)
  - Standard A\*
  - Randomized A\*
